# UD-Net
In recent years, the mortality rate of patients with rectal cancer is increasing. CT rectal examination is of great value in the survival rate of patients with early rectal cancer. Based on this, the project firstly used the CT image of rectal cancer and its corresponding mask image as the research object, and proposed a rectal tumor segmentation model combining U-Net and DenseNet. This model makes full use of the ability of neural network feature learning to effectively extract the rectum. Tumor characteristics information, accurate segmentation of the rectal tumor area, the experimental accuracy reached more than 90%. Furthermore, a rectal tumor classification model based on 3D convolutional neural network is proposed. This model uses the lymph nodes of the rectal tumor region to transfer to the research object, constructs a three-dimensional tensor of the tumor region information, and obtains the classification result of the rectal tumor. The classification accuracy is achieved. 65%.
